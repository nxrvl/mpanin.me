NXpose is a self-hosted alternative to ngrok. It lets you expose local services to the internet through encrypted tunnels with subdomain routing, TCP forwarding, OAuth2 authentication via GitHub/Google, automatic Let's Encrypt certificates, and a built-in admin panel. Ships as a single Go binary with DEB/RPM/PKG packages and Homebrew support.
