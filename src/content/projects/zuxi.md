Zuxi is an offline developer Swiss-army knife — a single static binary with 40+ commands for everyday dev tasks. Format and query JSON/YAML/TOML/XML, encode/decode Base64 and URLs, hash strings, decode JWTs, convert
timestamps, generate UUIDs, make HTTP requests, and more. Works as both a pipe-friendly CLI (`zuxi jsonfmt`) and an interactive TUI with live preview. No runtime dependencies, no telemetry, sub-50ms startup.
