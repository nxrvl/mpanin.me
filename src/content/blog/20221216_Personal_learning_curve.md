In my day to day work what I mostly do is managing people and trying to solve different problems and situation. It could be conflicts between tech and product teams, between tech and tech teams, managing stakeholder's expectations and etc. For this I developed and still developing soft skills such as commumication, empathy, conflict resolution and etc. But to make my position clearer and to build more trust I also developing my hard tech skills. So therefor I have my own way to learn new things. I will try to describe it here.

**Note** : I don't think that this way uniqe and different from common practices, but I feel that it will help me to organize my thoughts and maybe it will help somebody. It also helps me to boaden my tech expertise and to be more valuable for my team.
