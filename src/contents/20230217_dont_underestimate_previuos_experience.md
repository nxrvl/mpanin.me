Don't underestimate the value of your previous experience. I learned this after carefully reviewing how my past experiences have influenced how I work today. My first job was in IT back in 2004. Still, since then, I have also been the founder and CEO of a construction-trading company that achieved a 9-figure turnover before it was sold. I also founded a business that helped people buy property in the EU, a floristic company, and a consulting company that proposed solutions to the oil and gas sector, among others. Eventually, I returned to the IT industry in 2013 as a tech advisor and have since taken part in many projects.

All of my experiences in vastly different areas have taught me valuable lessons. For instance, working in the construction business as a CEO at a young age was challenging, as I dealt with people with significantly more experience and military backgrounds. However, through careful thought and clear communication, I earned their respect. Working in the property selling area taught me to pay close attention to deals' legal and financial details. Starting a flower-selling business helped me develop a product mindset, as we focused on providing customer value based on their specific needs. We spent a lot of time developing customer journey maps based on channels, requests, and needs.

And the list goes on. Each new experience has taught me something valuable that I use every day. So, take the time to review what you have done, and don't discount any experience as irrelevant. We are all learning something new every day, so make it a habit to reflect on your experiences and mark what you have learned.
